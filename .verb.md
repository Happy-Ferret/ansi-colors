This module was created to make it easy to allow color configuration through options. 

If your application will always one or two specific colors, we recommend directly requiring only [the necessary modules](#related-projects). 

If your application uses **more than 10 colors**, we recommend using [chalk][] for faster require times (since chalk loads everything at once). However, when using less than 10 colors this module will be more efficient due to lazy caching the [underlying modules](#related-projects).

## Usage

```js
var colors = require('{%= name %}');
```

{{#block "related"}}
