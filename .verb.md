## Why was this module created?

This module was created to make it easy to allow color configuration through options. This module inlines the code from [these other ansi-* modules](#related-projects) for faster load times. The lazy loading of the [underlying modules](#related-projects) modules has been moved to [ansi-colors-lazy][].

## Usage

```js
var colors = require('{%= name %}');
```
